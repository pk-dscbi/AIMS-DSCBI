# Module 3: Spatial Data 

## Objectives
Introduce participants to foundational tools and techniques for geospatial data analysis using Python.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this module, participants will be able to:
- Understand spatial data formats (vector and raster).
- Load and explore spatial datasets using geopandas, shapely, and rasterio.
- Perform spatial operations such as joins, clipping, and projections.
- Integrate spatial and tabular datasets.
- Generate zonal statistics and create interactive visualizations using folium.

## Topics
- Spatial data formats: vector vs. raster  
- Loading shapefiles and GeoJSON with geopandas  
- CRS and spatial projections  
- Spatial joins, buffering, clipping  
- Combining spatial and tabular datasets  
- Visualizing with geopandas, matplotlib, folium  
- Raster basics with rasterio  
- Use case: Mapping access to financial services in Mozambique
