# Module 6: Machine Learning

## Objectives
Introduce classical machine learning using scikit-learn, including supervised and unsupervised learning.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this module, participants will be able to:
- Understand machine learning workflows.
- Train and evaluate models like logistic regression, decision trees, and SVMs.
- Preprocess data and perform feature engineering.
- Evaluate models using accuracy, F1-score, etc.
- Avoid common pitfalls like overfitting and leakage.

## Topics
- ML concepts, workflows  
- Supervised vs unsupervised learning  
- Preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Models: logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, SVMs  
- Unsupervised models: clustering, PCA  
- Evaluation: confusion matrix, ROC, cross-validation  
- Hyperparameter tuning with grid search  
- Use cases: TBD
