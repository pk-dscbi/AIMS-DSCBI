# Datasets
As a good practice, we do not keetp the datasets within the repository partly becuas the datasets are large and GitHub doesnt typically allow storage of such large files unless you subscribe for Lage File Service (LFS). More importanly, data is often confidential and this is why its left out of GitHub in geneal. We are keeping our datasets in Google Drive. In most notebooks, the urls to the datasets are provided

For this course, the datasets have been selected to match with the module focus as well as relevance to the country Rwanda. We will provide a summary of these datasets for your reference.
