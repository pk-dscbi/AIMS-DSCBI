    "# Programming Assignment-2\n",
    "The goal of this assingment is to allow you to practice several the following things in Python:\n",
    "1. Perfoming typical data processing (or preprocessing if you prefer). This includes all the typical data wraning such as creating news variables, combining several datasets and more \n",
    "2. Running explolatory data analysis including basic plotting of variables \n",
    "3. Perfoming basic inferential statisticals using statsmodels and scipy to run hypythesis testing and build simple statistial or econometric models.\n",

    "## Datasets \n",
    "For this assignment, you will use the following datasets:\n",
    "### Rwanda Health Indicators\n",
    "The Excel file was generated by combining multiple CSV files, each containing data on different health indicators for Rwanda, So that each sheet in the file represent one such indicator. See below some of the input files which were used:\n",
    "- `access-to-health-care_subnational_rwa`\n",
    "- `child-mortality-rates_subnational_rwa`\n",
    "- `dhs-mobile_subnational_rwa`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can download the dataset from [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uvTQYS22VfXXo1Hwkm1frFx_bKkLQkcf/edit?usp=share_link&ouid=113302179168925233984&rtpof=true&sd=true).\n",

    "# Setup Input Folders\n",
    "\n",
    "As usual, it is good practice to set up input folders using the [`pathlib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) package. In this section, make sure to define the folders where your data is stored on your machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "I find it helpful to set up the working directory and input data folders right at the start of the notebook. To keep things organized, I use the naming convention: `FILE_{NAME}` for files and `DIR_{NAME}` for folders. We use capital letters because these are global variables that will be referenced throughout the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using the [`pathlib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) library, which offers several advantages over traditional string-based path handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cross-platform compatibility** - automatically handles path separators (`/` vs `\\`) across different operating systems\n",
    "- **Object-oriented approach** - paths are objects with useful methods rather than strings\n",
    "- **Intuitive syntax** - use `/` operator to join paths naturally: `parent_dir / \"subfolder\" / \"file.txt\"`\n",
    "- **Built-in path operations** - methods like `.exists()`, `.is_file()`, `.parent`, `.stem`, and `.suffix`\n",
    "- **Safer path manipulation** - reduces errors from manual string concatenation and splitting\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the recommended approach for managing file paths in modern Python development.\n"

    "## Introduction to Nightlights Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Nightlight Data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Nightlight data is satellite imagery capturing artificial light emissions from Earth's surface during nighttime. Satellites like VIIRS collect this data regularly, providing an **objective, real-time measure of human economic activity and development**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Raw Data: Radiance Measurements\n",
    "The fundamental measurement in nightlight data is **radiance** - the amount of light energy detected by satellite sensors, measured in **nanowatts per square centimeter per steradian (nW/cm²/sr)**. Each pixel in satellite imagery contains a radiance value representing the light intensity from that specific location on Earth's surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Annual Composite Generation\n",
    "This dataset was created from **annual composite images** using VIIRS nightlight files for Rwanda. Annual composites are generated by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Aggregating daily/monthly observations** throughout each year (2015, 2020, 2024)\n",
    "- **Filtering out temporary light sources** (fires, lightning, aurora)\n",
    "- **Removing cloud-affected observations** to ensure clear measurements\n",
    "- **Averaging or taking median values** to create stable, representative annual measurements\n",
    "- **Masking techniques** to exclude areas with unreliable data\n",
    "\n",
    "The files used include both **average composites** (`average_masked`) and **median composites** (`median_masked`), with **cloud-free versions** (`vcmslcfg`) preferred over cloud-inclusive versions (`vcmcfg`) for more accurate measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Nightlight Data?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Consistent global coverage** - Available everywhere, regardless of local data quality\n",
    "- **Real-time updates** - More current than traditional economic statistics\n",
    "- **Objective measurement** - Not subject to reporting biases\n",
    "- **High resolution** - Captures local development patterns\n",
    "- **Proxy for development** - Light intensity correlates with economic activity, infrastructure, and quality of life\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Overview \n",
    "\n",
