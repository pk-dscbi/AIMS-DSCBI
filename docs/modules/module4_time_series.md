# Module 4: Working with Time Series Data in Python

## Objectives
Equip participants with practical skills to analyze and interpret time series data using Python libraries.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this module, participants will be able to:
- Understand the structure of time series data.
- Preprocess temporal data and apply resampling techniques.
- Visualize trends and decompose time series.
- Forecast using statistical (ARIMA) and machine learning models (Prophet).
- Evaluate model performance.

## Topics
- Introduction to time series and use cases  
- Working with datetime objects  
- Resampling, rolling windows  
- Decomposition into trend, seasonality, residual  
- Visualization techniques  
- Forecasting with ARIMA, exponential smoothing  
- Forecasting with Prophet  
- Use case: TBD
